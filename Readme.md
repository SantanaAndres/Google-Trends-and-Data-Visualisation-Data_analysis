# Google Trends and Data Visualization

## Introduction

In this project, I utilized Jupyter Notebook along with Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and matplotlib.dates to analyze and explore the relationship between Google Trends search volume and various financial indicators. Google Trends provides an estimate of search volume, and by investigating its correlation with other datasets, we aim to uncover potential patterns and insights.

### Motivation

The project explores whether search popularity on Google Trends can be linked to the fluctuations in the price of significant financial assets such as Bitcoin or popular stocks like Tesla. Additionally, we investigate if the search volume for specific terms, such as "Unemployment Benefits," can provide valuable insights into real-world economic indicators like the unemployment rate.

### Data Sources

The analysis is based on data obtained from the following sources:

- [Unemployment Rate from FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE/)
- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore)
- [Yahoo Finance for Tesla Stock Price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?p=TSLA)
- [Yahoo Finance for Bitcoin Stock Price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD)

These diverse datasets allow for a comprehensive examination of potential correlations between Google Trends search volumes and financial indicators, shedding light on interesting patterns and relationships.
